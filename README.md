# Peloton Graph

Pulls metric data from the peloton API and uses it to build Github style graphs on [pixe.la](https://docs.pixe.la/)

Uses the [pylotoncycle](https://github.com/justmedude/pylotoncycle) library and [pixe.la](https://docs.pixe.la/) API.

Note: Code is mostly skeleton at this point, it was mainly a proof of concept project. The functions themselves work, 
but I have plans to use them in a bigger project down the road.
